# pythonsupertask
This program is used to theoretically create a "Supertask". A Supertask involves changing something an infinite amount of times within a finite time span. This program creates a super task by setting up a maximum time span and then waiting for half of that time, half of that, and then half of that, over and over until finally the timer hits the maximum time. Each time it waits is counted as a change. The theoretical aspect of it is that the result given varies highly on the fact it is made using Python, operated on various different computers and speed is physically hindered by processing speed. This is just a simple concept program used to visualize and explain supertasks.
